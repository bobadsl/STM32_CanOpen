# STM32_CanOpen
CanOpen Library based on my STM32_Can library. This library is a crude implementation on CanOpen

This library is a port of Due_CanOpen made by Collin Kidder [Link](https://github.com/collin80/due_canopen) to his repository
The [STM32_Can(https://github.com/StarlightNL/STM32_can)] library is needed for the communication with the on board can driver
